----------------------
This is a thresholded stack of the scala media volume within the
cochlea of the moustached bat.  The scale is 40 pixels per millimeter.
The original data set is from a uniform serial section of high
reslolution MRI done at the Duke Center for inVivo Microscopy
with tissue from the Dept. of Cell Biology and Anatomy at the
University of North Carolina.

To create a movie from this volume, first threshold the stack using
Image/Adjust/Threshold then perform Nearest Point projection using
Image/Stacks/Render.
