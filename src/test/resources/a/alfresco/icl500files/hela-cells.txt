Use the slider under the image to select the channel to be
processed or analyzed. Note how the color of the subtitle 
changes when you switch to a different channel. Use the B&C 
tool (press shift-c) to adjust the brightness and contrast of the 
current channel. Use the Image>Duplicate command to extract
a channel or to convert from a composite image to an ordinary 
stack. Use Image>Color> Convert Stack to RGB to convert to 
24-bit RGB. Use File>Save As>Tiff to save as a 48-bit TIFF.
